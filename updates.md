# What's next?
*Last updated on 12/21/18*

Student Insights is [open source](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights), which means that all code and all changes are published publicly.  We also aim to build in the open, and so much of our discussion about what to build and why is public as well.  We also believe in [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), and the idea that school communities should have the freedom to run, copy, change and improve their software.  If this is new to you, welcome!

We also release a short summary of changes each week as a [changelog](#changelog), aimed at the educators we collaborate with.  For longer term planning, we use a [work board](#work-board) to communicate about what we're working on right now, what's coming up soon, and potential projects a few months out.

If you'd like to collaborate with us, the best way to do this is to <a href="{{site.links.email}}">reach out over email</a> and we can help you get started.  Designers and developers can also join the local Code for Boston brigade on Tuesday nights, either in person or remotely.
