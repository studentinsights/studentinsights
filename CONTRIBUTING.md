# Contributing to Student Insights

This project is in active development.  Currently, we consider the code base an alpha product. We are still working out bugs and building out new features.  We'd love your help and encourage participation, collaboration and contribution to this project.  Here's how: 

## First, take a look around

As a first step, please take a little time to become familiar with the project at a high level by reviewing our [README.md](README.md) file and exploring around this repository.  To talk with other people about way to help, the best first step is to come drop into [chat](https://cfb-public.slack.com/messages/somerville-schools/), or connect with [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexsoble) or [Kevin](https://twitter.com/krob) on Twitter. 

If you're **an educator** and want to try this out or have ideas about how to improve the product, we'd love to hear from you.  If you're **an experienced developer or designer**, there's some work we could use help with and you dive right into it.  We'll work with you to make sure your work can ship and will immediately help out principals and teachers.

## Find something to help with!
At Code for Boston each week, we start by making an [agenda issue]( https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+agenda+).  This has the overall flow for the meeting, and can help you understand the broad product priorities and find something that aligns with your interests and skillset.  There's often not a perfect match, so we bias slightly towards finding something where contributors can jump in and start working right away, even if that's not the highest priority at the moment.  

When talking about or suggesting product and design improvements, it's helpful to frame these in a few different steps:
  1. Identify what problem we're trying to help the user with and why it matters.
  2. What design or UX improvements can help the user with that problem? What are the tradeoffs in the solution?
  3. How can we execute on sequencing the work or building it in code?

See [this issue](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues/307#issuecomment-210643323) for a great example of this.

## Get input from other folks
If you're making a large change, talk to other folks first to get feedback.  Or if you're making a change to a tricky part of the codebase, ask someone for help with that too!

There's a `studentinsights-bot` account connected to a `student-insights-mention-bot` app that will chime in if you're making changes to things like `production.rb` as well.  If you have other ideas here, check out the [mention-bot](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot) docs and edit the `.mention-bot` file in this repo.

## Have an Issue With Us?  Good! 
One of the most valuable ways anybody can contribute to this project is by identifying bugs and other issues to look at.  It is easy to create an issue ticket on GitHub with the [click of a button](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues/new). Before you submit a new issue, please take a look at the other issues (both [open](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [closed](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and the [README](README.md) file to check if it is already be addressed.  

## If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Hack Night! 
Join us on Tuesday night at [Code for Boston](http://www.codeforboston.org) to work on the project together in person, we could use your help!  Each week folks are shipping incremental improvements, prototyping new features and squashing bugs, all while learning new things and meeting new people.  We typically create an [agenda issue]( https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+agenda+) for each meeting.

## Contribute Your Work by Submitting a Pull Request
Often, pull requests come out of really good thinking, feedback or discussions.  It's extremely helpful to summarize these as part of submitting a pull request.  See [this issue](https://github.com/studentinsights/studentinsights/issues/307#issuecomment-210643323) for a great example.

If you need help with how to submit a pull request, check out the awesome [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), or this [walkthrough tutorial](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) on the workflow for working on projects in GitHub.
