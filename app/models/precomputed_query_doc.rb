class PrecomputedQueryDoc < ActiveRecord::Base
  # A key-value store for holding a precomputed JSON doc, like Redis but durable since it's precomputed
  # and not a read-through cache.
  # The primary key means nothing, and reads and writes should be done on the `key` column, which
  # has an index and uniqueness constraint.

  # The original formats to this key concatenated all student_ids but is deprecated and
  # no longer used (although it's still here since data still exists thats keyed like that).
  # That can be accessed with `force_deprecated_key`.
