# This class defines authorization rules.
# If you want student data, ask through this class.
# Ideally, start with using `authorized`.
# Drop down to calling individual methods if you need to.
#
# This class should be fully tested, and all changes should be reviewed.
#
# Controller usage:
#   student = authorized { Student.find(params[:id]) }
#   homeroom = authorized { Homeroom.(params[:id]) }
#   students = authorized { homeroom.students }
#
# Standalone usage:
#   authorizer = Authorizer.new(educator)
#   student = authorizer.authorized { Student.find(params[:id]) }
#   homeroom = authorizer.authorized { Homeroom.(params[:id]) }
#   students = authorizer.authorized { homeroom.students }
#
# Instead of:
#   Homeroom.find(id).students # no authorization check
#   Section.find(id).students # no authorization check
#   current_educator.homeroom.students # doesn't work for all roles because
#     some roles don't have homeroom associations (e.g. if they're school-wide)
#   current_educator.school.students # doesn't work for all roles because
#     some roles don't have school associations (e.g. if they're district-wide)

  # actually has access to those students too.  This second layer only slows down
  # dopplegangers, and adds another layer of protection to ensure that we only ever
  # show dopplegangers the intersection of who `view_as_educator` would see and
  # who they are authorized to see themselves.

  # There are several performance optimizations applied here (see git history
  # for more), since this method is heavily used and latency regressions impact
  # almost every page.  The latency of this method is also quite different for
  # different users, because of the different layers of checks.  Users with
  # districtwide or schoolwide access may have lower latency (and are therefore bad
  # test cases) since we don't need to care about the details when checking their
